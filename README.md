This repository contains the training and testing datasets used in the experiments of the paper  titled: "Compensation Guarantees in Crowdsourced Delivery: Impact on the Platform and Driver Welfare", authored by Aliaa Alnaggar, Fatma Gzara, and James Bookbinder.

The dataset is a filteration of the Chicago ride-hailing trip dataset (TNP-Chicago-Trips 2019), which we use to train and test the proposed value function approximation algorithm.
